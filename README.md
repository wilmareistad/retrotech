# RetroTech – Laravel Admin Tool

RetroTech is a Laravel-based admin system for managing retro gaming consoles.

The application simulates a simple webshop admin panel where products and brands can be created, edited, filtered and deleted.

This project was built as part of a Laravel course assignment to practice building a CRUD application using a framework.

**Category:** Electronics 

## Features

- Login / logout with authentication
- Dashboard with greeting and product overview
- Full CRUD for products
- Full CRUD for brands
- Filter by brand and condition
- Sort by price and time of creation
- Pagination with filters preserved

## Filters

Products can be filtered by **brand** and **condition**, and the filters can be combined.

## Pagination

10 products per page on dashboard and 15 per page on products page.

## Factories & Seeders

The project uses factories and seeders so the application looks the same on every machine.

**Brands:** Nintendo, Sony, Microsoft, Sega, Atari

**Conditions:** New, Like New, Good, Acceptable, For Parts

**Products** are generated with `ProductFactory` using realistic retro console names such as Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 3, Sega Dreamcast and Xbox 360.
